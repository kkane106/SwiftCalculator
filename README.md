# SwiftCalculator

Utilize auto layout constraints to create a calculator that will fit any screen size/orientation. Exercise completed entirely programmatically in Swift without the use of Interface Builder.

Special thanks to Thii (https://github.com/thii), for the SwiftColors UIColor extension that allowed me to use HEX colors so easily!
